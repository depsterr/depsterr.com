# About

## Who am I?

I am a Swedish student currently studying at [NTI Johanneberg](https://www.ntigymnasiet.se/johanneberg/). In my spare time I (among other things) enjoy learning about the inner workings of computers, writing code and fiddling with my config files. At the moment I exclusively use Unix based operating systems, my favourite programming language is C and my text editor of choice is vim.

## What's this site for?

Not very much. I post about programming and other geek related stuff on the [blog page](/blog/).

## Site info

This site was running on [srws](https://github.com/depsterr/srws), my own web server. However it is currently running on [quark](https://tools.suckless.org/quark/). The server computer itself is a self hosted machine running OpenBSD.

You can find the source of this site (and the creation scripts) under the [depsterr.com git repo](/git/depsterr.com/files.html)
