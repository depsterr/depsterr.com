# About

## Who am I?

I'm a person. In my spare time I (among other things) enjoy learning about the inner workings of things, writing code and fiddling with my config files. At the moment I exclusively use Unix based operating systems, my favourite programming language is C and my text editor of choice is vim.

I also like listening to music, and if you wish you can view my bandcamp collection [here](bandcamp.com/deppy).

## What's this site for?

Whatever I feel like putting here.

## Site info

This site was running on [srws](https://github.com/depsterr/srws), my own shitty web server (I'll write a better one some day, I swear). However it is currently running on [quark](https://tools.suckless.org/quark/). The server computer itself is a self hosted machine running OpenBSD.

The source for the site is made up of markdown files that are converted into html using [smu](https://github.com/Gottox/smu) and a shell script I wrote. You can find the source for this site (as well as the build scripts) in the [depsterr.com git repo](/git/depsterr.com/files.html).

The git repos are generated using [stagit](https://git.codemadness.org/stagit/file/README.html) and post-update git hooks.
