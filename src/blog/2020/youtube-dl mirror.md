# youtube-dl mirror

Since the [RIAA](https://www.riaa.com/) have deployed their lawyers and decided they want to take down [youtube-dl](https://yt-dl.org/) from github I will now be mirroring a copy of the source code at [depsterr.com/res/youtube-dl-2020.09.20.tar.gz](/res/youtube-dl-2020.09.20.tar.gz). As well as on [depsterr.com/git/youtube-dl/files.html](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md). If anyone has the original git repository with the commit history please email me and I'll host it instead.

Read the statement from the RIAA [here](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md).
