# Philosophy

The philosophy of GNU KISS Linux is simple, maximize usability while maintaining simplicity.

GKISS allows proprietary packages in the community repository as well as the inclusion of software such as dbus in the community repository. However, it's important to note that just because dbus is packaged it is not encouraged, dbus is packaged to enable using applications which rely upon it. Applications which do not depend upon it are still encouraged to avoid it.

Using glibc and allowing software such as dbus to be packaged in community enables the installation of prepackaged binaries as well as proprietary packages.
